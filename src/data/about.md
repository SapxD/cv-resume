# Intro

I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, Cloud and Cyber Security. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

I have been actively looking for work. Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to develop my skills in Cyber Security, Application Development and Project Management further, like I was doing in my previous role. Learning New Technologies like [GO](https://go.dev/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and newbie to [Cyber Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security).
